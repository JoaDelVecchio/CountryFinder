# 🌍 Country Finder with Real-Time Weather Information

This project is a **React application** that provides detailed information about countries along with real-time weather data for the capital city. It's designed to showcase **API integration** skills, **state management** in React, and efficient use of modern tools like **Vite** for fast development.

## 📋 Features

- **Search** for countries and get:
  - Official name and capital.
  - Population size and spoken languages.
  - Display of the national flag.
- **Real-Time Weather Information** for the capital city using OpenWeatherMap API:
  - Current temperature in Celsius.
  - Wind speed in meters per second.
  - General weather description (e.g., "clear sky", "cloudy").
  - Weather icon representation.

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **React**: Modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for fetching data from APIs.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For real-time weather information.
- **REST Countries API**: For country-specific information.
- **Vite**: A lightning-fast build tool for modern web development.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project demonstrates my ability to build a responsive and user-friendly React application with:

- **RESTful API Integration**: Seamlessly fetch and display data from two different APIs.
- **State Management**: Handle complex state in a React application, including asynchronous data fetching.
- **Environment Configuration**: Use of environment variables to securely manage API keys.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle and display errors when API requests fail.
- **Performance Optimization**: Built with Vite for rapid development and optimized production builds.
